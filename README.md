# Dave Likes Pizza Too!

This game is still in development. In the meantime, you can check out its [predecessor](http://willyg302.github.io/Dave-Likes-Pizza/).

## Developing

### Quick Start

1. Install [strap](https://github.com/willyg302/strap.py)

2. Grab *Dave Likes Pizza Too!*, build it, and start the development server

   ```bash
   strap init gh:willyg302/DaveLikesPizzaToo
   cd DaveLikesPizzaToo
   strap run build
   strap
   ```

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your favorite browser to play the game.
